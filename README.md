# Terminal Velocity Notebook

Building a [marino](https://marimo.io/) to calculate the terminal velocity of an object on different planets.

This really isn't that interesting of a project, but the goal is to learn the [marino](https://marimo.io/) notebook framework and end up with a nice dynamic notebook that allows a user to modify the mass to see the terminal velocity.
